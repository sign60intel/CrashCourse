* *What is the .NET Framework*
  - *The infrastructure for the overall .NET Platform*
  - A computing platform designed to simpify application development
  - A consistent object-oriented programming environment
  - A code-execution environment that minimizes software deployment and versioning conficts

** *_Major Components of .NET Framework_*
     - Common Language Runtime (CLR)
       - Manages code execution at runtime
       - Manages memory, threads etc
       - Code designed for the CLR is referred to as {{{color(red, Managed Code)}}}
         - Object oriented
         - Cross-language integration
         - Cross-language {{{color(red, exception handling)}}}
         - Multiple version support
     - Base Class Library (Framework Class Library - FCL)
       - Object-oriented collection of reusable types
       - Sits on-top of the Common Language Runtime (CLR)
     - Commont Type System (CTS)
     - Common Language Specification (CLS)

** *_.NET Framework Structure_*
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1000px
[[./images/introduction-to-dotnet-10-728.jpg]]

* *_Common Language Runtime (CLR)_*
  - *CLR* works like a *virtual machine* in executing all languages
  - Checking and enforcing security restrictions on the running code
  - Manages memory through an extremely efficient garbage collectory
  - Common Type System (CTS)
  - Conversion from IL into code native to the platform being executed on

** *_Common Language Runtime (CLR)_*
   - *All .NET languages must obey the rules and standard imposed by CLR.* Examples:
     - Object declaration, creation and use
     - Data types, language libraries
     - Error and exception handling
     - Interactive Development Environment (IDE)

** *_Common Language Runtime (CLR)_*
   - *CLR* manages object layout and references to objects
   - Objects whose lifetimes are managed by the *CLR* are referred to as *Managed Data*
   - Automatic memory management reduces memory leaks
   - In *Managed Code* you can use:
     - *Managed Data*
     - *Unmanaged Data*
     - Both

** *_Common Language Runtime (CLR)_*
   - All *CLR*_compliant compilers use a common type system
     - Allows for cross-language inheritance
     - Passing object instances across language barriers
     - Invoking methods across language barriers
   - Managed components exposes metadata
   - Metadata includes
     - Resources component was compiled against
     - Information about types and dependencies
     - Signatures of each type's method
     - Members that your code references
     - Other runtime data for CLR

** *_One Runtime For Many Languages_*
   - CLR is on open standard
   - Any language can make use of CLR services
   - Any language can use classes written in any other language
   - Any language can inherit classes written in any other language

** *_Common Type System (CTS)_*
   - *CTS is a rich type system built into the CLR*
     - Implements various types (int, double, etc)
   - *Strictly enforces type safety*
   - *Ensures that classes are compatible with each other by describing them in a common way*
   - *Enables types in one language to interoperate with types in another language*

** *_Common Data Types_*
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1000px
[[./images/introduction-to-net-framework-37-728.jpg]]

** *_Common Language Specification (CLS)_*
   - *CLS is a set of specifications that language and library designers need to follow*
     - This will ensure interoperability between languages
   - *Specification that a language must conform to, to be accepted into the .NET framework*
   - *The specification are detailed at* [[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm]]

** *_Intermediate Language (IL)_*
   - *.NET languages are not compiled to machine code.* They are compiled to an *Intermedaite Language (IL)*
   - *CLR accepts the IL code and recompiles it to machine code.* The recompilation is *Just-In-Time* (JIT) meaning it is done as soon as a function or subroutine is called.
   - *The JIT code stays in memory for subsequent calls.* In cases where there is not enough memory it is discarded thus making JIT process interpretive.

** *_.NET Framework Class Libraries_*
   - Sit on top of the CLR
   - Reusable types that tightly intergrate with the CLR
   - Object oriented - inheritance, polymorphism, etc
   - Provide functionality for ASP.NET, XML Web Services, ADO.NET, Windows Forms, basic system functionality (IO, XML, etc)

* *_.NET Assemblies_*
  - Assemblies are the smallest unit of code distribution, deployment and versioning
  - Individual components are packaged into unit called {{{color(red, assemblies)}}}
  - Can be {{{color(red, dynamically loaded into the execution engine on demand)}}}
  - Contains *Control Intermedaite Language (CIL)* code to be executed
  - Security boundary - permissions are granted at the assembly level
  - Type boundary - all types include the assembly name they are a part of
** *_Single File & Multi File Assemblies_*
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[./images/SingleMulti.png]]
** *_Assembly Characteristics_*
   - *Self-describing*
     - To enable data-driven execution
   - *Platform-independent*
   - *Bounded by name*
     - Locate assemblies by querying four-part tuple that consist of a human-friendly name, an international culture, a multipart version number, an a public key token
   - *Assembly loading is sensitive to version and policy*
     - Assemblies are loaded using tunable biding rules, which allow programmers and administrators to contribute policy to assembly-loading behaviour
   - *Validated*
     - Each time an assembly is loaded, it is subjected to a series of checks to ensure the assembly's integrity
** *_Self-describing of Assemblies_*
   - *Modules*
     - Blueprint for types in the form of metadata and CIL
     - Single file containing the structure and behaviour for some or all the types and/or resources found in the assembly
   - *An assembly always contains at least one module but has the capacity to include more*
   - *Assemblies themselves have metadata that describe their structure:* {{{color(red, manifest)}}}
** *_Manifest*
   - *Compounds name for the assembly*
   - *Describes the public types that the assembly exports*
   - *Describes types that the assembly will import from other assemblies*
** *_Reflection_*
   - Programmatically gain access to *Metadata* at *runtime*
   - Used to make *ultra-flexible* code
   - Components often perform *reflection* to find about derivations
     - Custom attributes
   - Late and loose binding are possible with *reflection*
     - Instantiate objects, call methods, etc
   - *Reflection Emit*
     - Possible to emit IL at *runtime*, JIT compile & execute
* *_Microsoft Intermedaite Language (CIL)_*
  - *Managed Code* is compiled into *Common Intermediate Language(CIL)*
  - CPU-independent set of instructions
    - Loading, storing, initializing and calling methods
    - Arithmetic and logical operations, etc
    - Control flow, exception handling, direct memory access
  - Is {{{color(red, Object-Oriented)}}}
  - Is {{{color(red, Stack-Based)}}}
** *_Ececution Process in .NET_*
   - Source code is converted in CIL wich is equivalent to assembly language for a CPU
   - *CIL* is then assembled into a for of so-called bytecode and .NET assembly is created
   - Upon execution of a .NET assembly, its code is passed through the runtime's JIT compiler to generate native code
   - Ahead-of-time compilation may also be used, which eliminates the JIT step, but at hte cost of executable-file portability
   - The computer's processor executes the native code

** *_Object-Oriented Concepts_*
   - CIL may create objects, call methods and use other types of class members such as fields
   - CIL is designed to be *Object-Oriented* and every *method* (with some exception) needs to reside in a class
   - *Instance classes*
     - An *instance class contains at least one constructor and some instance members.
   - *CIL* has instructions for *creating* objects
   - *CIL* has instructions for *invoking* instance methods
** *_CIL Instruction Groups_*
   - *CIL* bytecode has *instructions* for the following groups of tasks:
     - load and store
     - arithmetic
     - type conversion
     - object creation and manipulation
     - operand stack management (push, pop)
     - control transfer (branching)
     - method invocation and return
     - throwing exceptions
     - monitor-based concurrency
     - data and function pointers manipulation needed for C++ and unsafe C# code
** *_Minimal Hello Program in CIL_*
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
.assembly Hello {}
.method public static void Main() cil managed
{
  .entrypoint
  .maxstack 1
  ldstr "Hello, world!"
  call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
  ret
}
#+END_SRC
** *_Sample of CIL Bytecode_*
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
assembly              bytecode           purpose
ldarga argNum            FE 0A           fetch the adress given as argument
brtrue                   2D              branch when the previous result is true
break                    01              exit a loop
#+END_SRC
** *_CIL Evaluation Stack_*
   - Stack is the data structure that follows *Last In and First Out(LIFO)* kind of data storing method i.e the type present at the top are the first one to be removed from it. The below example makes it clear.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 900px
[[./images/stack.jpg]]
** *_CIL Evaluation Stack_*
   - *Evaluation Stack* is used to hold the local variable or the method argument before they are evaluated. Before the start of every method the evaluation stack is empty and during the execution of the method the *CIL* instructions adds/removes the items from the *evaluation stack*, the end result of which is an empty evaluation stack at the end of that method execution.
   - Instruction that copy values from memory to the *evaluation stack* are called *Load* and the instruction that copy values from the *evaluation stack* back to memory are called *Store*. All the Opcodes starting with *ld* are used for *loading* the item on the stack and the Opcodes starting with *st* are used for *storing* the item in the memory. The instruction used for *storing* the data in memory also result in *popping off* the item from the *evaluation stack*.
** *_CIL Evaluation Stack_*
   - At the beginning of the function it is required to provide the maximum items that would be present on that stack at any particular time, this is done using *.maxstack* directive. If this is not provided the *.maxstack*  value would be defaulted to *8*. We can easily provide the size of the stack by static analysis of the method, looking for the number of variables in the method. Also it should be noted that *maxstack* doesn't represent the size of the *stack frame*, it is just the number of items on the *evaluation stack*. The *maxstack* value can be easily determined by analyzing the method and seeing how many variables and parameters it has.
** *_CIL Evaluation Stack Example_*
   - C# code
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
static void add()
{
    int value1 = 10;
    int value2 = 20;
    int value3 = value1 + value2;
}
#+END_SRC
** *_CIL Evaluation Stack Example_
   - CIL code
 #+BEGIN_SRC c++
 0.method private hidebysig static void  'add'() cil managed
 {
   // Code size       12 (0xc)
   .maxstack  2
   .locals init ([0] int32 value1,
            [1] int32 value2,
            [2] int32 value3) // three int32 local variables are declared

   IL_0000:  nop  // no operation ( no push or pop on the stack)

   IL_0001:  ldc.i4.s   10  //loads the int32 value(10) on the stack. Item on Stack=1

   IL_0003:  stloc.0 // pops off the item from the stack and stores in first local variable.
                     //Item on Stack=0

   IL_0004:  ldc.i4.s   20 //loads the int32 value(20) on the stack.Item on the stack =1

   IL_0006:  stloc.1 0 // pops off the item from the stack and stores in second local variable .
                       //Item on Stack=0

   IL_0007:  ldloc.0// Loads the value of first local variable on the stack. Item on Stack=1

   IL_0008:  ldloc.1// Loads the value of second local variable on the stack. Item on Stack=2

   IL_0009:  add //(Pops off first two numeric value from the stack and sends the result
                 // back to the stack) //Item on stack=2-2+1=1
   IL_000a:  stloc.2 //(Pop off the item from the stack and store it in local variable [3].
                     //Item on the Stack=0

   IL_000b:  ret
 } // end of method Program::'add'
 #+END_SRC

* *_Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiling_*
  - *Assemblies* are compiled to native code by a *JIT compiler* before executing
  - Compiled assemblies include *metadata*
  - No Type Libraries or Interface Definition Language (IDL))
  - JIT compilers are built into the CLR for every supported CPU architecture
  - JIT compilers convert *CIL* to native on demand
  - Resulting native code is stored fro reuse
  - JIT compiling occurs for each method after the application is restarted

** *_Classic Compilation vs .NET Compilation_*
